                    Throughout this process, you will be reading various
                    groups of text. You will be tested on each group in terms
                    of reading speed and comphresion. The text will be displayed
                    in blocks of varying widths with the goal being to
                    find which text block width is the most efficient to
                    read at.

                    Sarah decided to go to the mall last Friday. She decided to 
                    go to the mall because there was a special on shoes at 
                    Macy’s. The shoe that she was looking for was running shoes. 
                    Her old running shoes were getting worn out. Sarah had those 
                    running shoes for two years and would run biweekly in them 
                    outside. She would run with her friends Benjamin and Stacy. 
                    Benjamin works at the local Sear’s in the mall with the 
                    Macy’s. He got his start there three years ago because his 
                    friend Jeff worked there. Stacy is currently employed at 
                    the nearby JC Penney. She is a cashier there and works every 
                    day except Monday and Thursday. 
                    Stacy is looking forward to using her employee discount 
                    on a new pair of sandals.
